About
-----

SMS Framework provides a modular API for Drupal to interact with SMS messages.

The project bundles the the following optional modules which improve integration
and add extra features.

SMS Actions
-----------

Status: Not upgraded for Drupal 8. See https://www.drupal.org/node/2641888

Provides an action for sending outgoing messages and the ability to define 
custom triggers for incoming messages.

SMS Blast
---------

Allows bulk text messages to be sent to users.

SMS Devel
---------

Development and testing tools to assist developers and site builders working 
with SMS Framework.

SMS Send to Phone
-----------------

Status: Not upgraded for Drupal 8. See https://www.drupal.org/node/331629

Provides ways to share nodes via SMS.

SMS User
--------

Provides integration with Drupal users.

Gateways
--------

SMS gateways are provided by dedicated modules. A list of gateways for SMS
Framework can be found at https://www.drupal.org/node/2641028

Installation
------------

 1. Install the SMS Framework module.
 2. Install the module for your gateway provider. See 
    https://www.drupal.org/node/2641028 for a list of modules.
 3. Add an instance of your new gateway by going to Administration » 
    Configuration » SMS Framework » Gateways. Then use the 'Add gateway' button.
 4. (optional) Configure entity phone numbers at Administration » Configuration 
    » SMS Framework » Phone number settings. Then user the 'Add phone number
    settings' button. Typical scenarios add the 'User/User' bundle. This form
    requires, and provides the option to automatically add, a phone number field
    on the entity.

Optional Configuration
----------------------

SMS Framework automatically adds an improved token selection UI to SMS message
forms if the Token module (https://drupal.org/project/token) is installed.

Documentation
-------------

Documentation for site builders and developers is available in the Drupal.org
handbook pages: http://drupal.org/node/362258
The `sms.api.php` file and `\Drupal\sms\Event\SmsEvents` class contain
information about events which third parties can hook into. There are examples
of operation in the included test modules.

something like:

    modules/smsframework$ ../../vendor/bin/phpunit --filter SmsFrameworkQueueTest
